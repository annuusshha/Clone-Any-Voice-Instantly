# Clone-Any-Voice-Instantly
This repository is an implementation of [Transfer Learning from Speaker Verification to
Multispeaker Text-To-Speech Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.04558.pdf) (SV2TTS) with a vocoder that works in real-time. 
SV2TTS is a three-stage deep learning framework that allows to create a numerical representation of a voice from a few seconds of audio, and to use it to condition a text-to-speech model trained to generalize to new voices.


## Setup

### 1. Install Requirements

**Python 3.6 or 3.7** is needed to run the toolbox.

* Install [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) (>=1.0.1).
* Install [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html#get-packages).
* Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the remaining necessary packages.

### 2. Download Pretrained Models
Download the latest [here](https://github.com/CorentinJ/Real-Time-Voice-Cloning/wiki/Pretrained-models).

### 3. (Optional) Test Configuration
Before you download any dataset, you can begin by testing your configuration with:

`python demo_cli.py`

If all tests pass, you're good to go.

### 4. (Optional) Download Datasets
For playing with the toolbox alone, I only recommend downloading [`LibriSpeech/train-clean-100`](https://www.openslr.org/resources/12/train-clean-100.tar.gz). Extract the contents as `<datasets_root>/LibriSpeech/train-clean-100` where `<datasets_root>` is a directory of your choosing. Other datasets are supported in the toolbox, see [here](https://github.com/CorentinJ/Real-Time-Voice-Cloning/wiki/Training#datasets). You're free not to download any dataset, but then you will need your own data as audio files or you will have to record it with the toolbox.

### 5. Launch the Toolbox
You can then try the toolbox:

`python demo_toolbox.py -d <datasets_root>`  
or  
`python demo_toolbox.py`  

depending on whether you downloaded any datasets.
